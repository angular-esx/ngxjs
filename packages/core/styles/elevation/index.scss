// A collection of mixins and CSS classes that can be used to apply elevation to a material
// element.
// See: https://www.google.com/design/spec/what-is-material/elevation-shadows.html

// Colors for umbra, penumbra, and ambient shadows. As described in the design doc, each elevation
// level is created using a set of 3 shadow values, one for umbra (the shadow representing the
// space completely obscured by an object relative to its light source), one for penumbra (the
// space partially obscured by an object), and one for ambient (the space which contains the object
// itself). For a further explanation of these terms and their meanings, see
// https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Umbra,_penumbra_and_antumbra.
